~~I post bugs, tricks, exploits and other stuff here when I feel like it.~~

As there are more people contributing now, this is a general repo for all csgo exploits that provide a competitive advantage.

Why post stuff like this in public? Valve doesn't care anymore, see the [model_bug](model_bug).
